1.
--->A given Angular workspace contains several TypeScript configuration files. At the root tsconfig. json file specifies the base TypeScript and Angular compiler options that all projects in the workspace inherit.


2.We can do this by adding another variable to our ngFor expression and making it equal to index, like:
--->We create another variable called 'i' and make it equal to the special keyword index.
--->We can use the variable 'i' just like we can use the variable person in our template.
ex: <ul> (1)
        <li *ngFor="let item of array; let i = index"> (1)
            {{ i + 1 }} - {{ item }} (2)
        </li>
    </ul>
